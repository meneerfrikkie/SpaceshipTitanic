### 1. Commit Message Format

- Begin each commit message with a capital letter.

### 2. Commit Types

Use one of the following commit types as a prefix in your commit message:

- **Add**: For new features or functionalities.
- **Update**: For updates or modifications to existing features.
- **Fix**: For bug fixes.
- **Remove**: For removal of code, files, or features.
- **Refactor**: For code refactoring without changing its external behavior.
- **Docs**: For documentation-related changes.
- **Style**: For changes that do not affect the code's functionality (e.g., formatting).
- **Test**: For adding or modifying tests.
- **Chore**: For changes to the build process, dependencies, or other miscellaneous tasks.

### 3. Additional Guidelines

- Keep each commit focused on a single task or change.
- Use meaningful commit messages that describe the purpose of the change.
- If the commit addresses an open issue, reference the issue number in the commit message.
