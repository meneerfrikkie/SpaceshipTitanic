## Description

This repository contains a Python Jupyter notebook and files related to the ELEN4025 Group Report. In the notebook, five machine-learning models are employed to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension, utilizing data frames sourced from Kaggle. The models utilized include _Logistic Regression_, _Random Forest Classification_, _Na√Øve Bayes_, _XCB Classification_, and _CatBoost Classification_.

Kaggle stands as a prominent data science platform renowned for hosting competitions and challenges in the field. It boasts a vibrant community comprising data scientists, statisticians, and machine learning experts who actively contribute their expertise to various projects.

For the analysis at hand, the Spaceship Titanic dataset available on Kaggle is utilized. The central objective of this study is to determine which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension following a spaceship collision. 

The methodology involves an initial phase of data analysis, followed by feature engineering to facilitate model construction. Subsequently, the models are trained and evaluated using the provided dataset. Ultimately, comprehensive assessments are conducted on all four models to identify the optimal approach for predicting passenger transportation to alternate dimensions.
